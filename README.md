> This is Vim's brain on JavaScript

Okay, okay.  It's a smaller brain than Vim's. But as Vim's younger brutha, Jim
keeps learning new things.  And yes, it's JavaScript compiled from Coffeescript.

Plug Jim into Ace or Cloud9 and you're modal editing again...

What works so far
-----------------
* modes: normal, visual (characterwise and linewise), insert, replace
* insert switches: `i`, `a`, `o`, `O`, `I`, `A`, and `C`
* commands: `D`, `gJ`, `J`, `p`, `P`, `r`, `s`, `x`, `X`, and `u`
* visual mode commands: `gJ`, `J`, `p` and `P`
* operators: `c`, `d`, `y`, `>`, and `<` in normal and visual modes (double
  operators work as linewise commands in normal mode, too)
* motions (can be used with counts and/or operators, and in visual mode)
  * `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`
  * `W`, `E`, `B`, `w`, `e`, `b`
  * `0`, `^`, `$`
  * `G`, `gg`
  * `H`, `M`, `L`
  * `/`, `?`, `n`, `N`
  * `f`, `F`, `t`, `T`
* default register (operations yank text in the the register for pasting)
* `u` works as it does in Vim (`Cmd-z` and `Cmd-y` still work as they do in Ace)

Next up

Hack
----
```
git clone git://github.com/misfo/jim.git
cd jim
git submodule update --init
```

Then just open index.html and you're good to go.

Chrome needs a special command line argument to allow XHRs to files:
`google-chrome --allow-file-access-from-files`

While developing, keep your CoffeeScript compiling in the background:

```bash
cake watch
```

Open test/test.html to run the tests

Chromeless (experimental)
-------------------------
Jim can be run as a [Chromeless](https://github.com/mozilla/chromeless)
app that has (very) basic Open/Save file capabilities.  Once you've
installed Chromeless just point it at Jim's directory:
```
~/code/chromless/chromeless ~/code/jim/
```

Chromeless is very experimental and the file capabilities
that Jim has are only kinda tested, so keep any files you're editing in
Git.  If it eats your file or slaps your grandma, don't say you weren't
warned...
